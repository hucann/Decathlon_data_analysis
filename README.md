# Decathlon Data Analysis

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing Decathlon data.

## Contents

1. [Decathlon_Part_1_SQL.txt](Decathlon_Part_1_SQL.txt): SQL script for data preprocessing and analysis.
2. [Decathlon_Part_2_Data_Analysis.ipynb](Decathlon_Part_2_Data_Analysis.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook for further data analysis using Python.

## Running the Code

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed on your system. Place the dataset file ("your_dataset.csv") in the same folder as the notebook file. Follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Place the dataset file ("Recruitment_Transactions_ToBeDistributed.csv") in the same folder as the Jupyter Notebook file.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file ("Decathlon_Part_2_Data_Analysis.ipynb") using Jupyter.
4. Execute the code cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis.

To run the SQL script, you'll need a database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) installed. Execute the script in your preferred database environment.
